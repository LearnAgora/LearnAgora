==========

1) Installing LearnAgora
------------------------

As LearnAgora uses [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to get started is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, run the Composer install:

    php composer.phar install

[1]:  http://getcomposer.org/
